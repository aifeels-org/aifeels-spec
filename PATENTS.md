# Patent Policy

## Intellectual Property Rights

Aifeels is an open standard developed under a **royalty-free patent policy**.

## Patent Non-Assertion

Contributors and maintainers of the Aifeels specification agree **not to assert** any patents they hold against implementations of this specification.

This applies to:
- Any patents covering the normative requirements in SPEC.md
- Any patents covering the reference implementation
- Any patents covering conformant third-party implementations

## Contribution Terms

By contributing to this specification (via RFCs, PRs, or other means), you agree:

1. **License Grant:** You grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to your contributions under Apache 2.0
2. **Patent Grant:** You grant a license to any patents you hold that are necessarily infringed by implementing the specification
3. **No Additional Terms:** You will not impose additional IP restrictions on implementers

## Disclosure Requirements

If you are aware of patents (yours or others') that might be infringed by implementations of this specification, you MUST disclose them:

1. Open an issue: https://github.com/aifeels-org/aifeels-spec/issues
2. Title: "[PATENT DISCLOSURE]"
3. Include: Patent number, jurisdiction, owner, and brief description

## Essential Claims

An "essential claim" is a patent claim that:
- Cannot be avoided by a conformant implementation
- Is not a trivial or obvious variation
- Is actually covered by the normative specification

## Defensive Termination

This patent license terminates if you:
- Assert any patent against an Aifeels implementation
- Assert any patent against Aifeels contributors
- Initiate patent litigation related to this specification

## No Warranty

This specification is provided "as-is" with no warranties regarding non-infringement. Implementers should conduct their own patent reviews.

## Reference

This policy is modeled after:
- W3C Patent Policy (Royalty-Free mode)
- Apache License 2.0 patent grant
- Open Web Foundation Agreement

## Questions?

Patent policy questions should be directed to the maintainers via a private channel (to be established) or as a GitHub issue.
