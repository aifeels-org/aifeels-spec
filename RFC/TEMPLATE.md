# RFC-NNNN: [Title]

## Summary

One-paragraph summary of the proposal.

## Motivation

### Problem Statement
What problem does this solve? Why is it important?

### Current Limitations
What can't you do today that this would enable?

### Evidence
Real-world examples, implementation experiences, or data showing the need.

## Proposal

### Detailed Design

Describe the proposed change in detail. Include:
- What changes in the spec?
- New schemas, if any
- Event definitions, if any
- Action triggers, if any
- Examples of usage

### Specification Changes

Which sections of SPEC.md would change?

**Example:**
```
Section 3.2: Add new primitive "impatience"
Section 4.2: Add events that affect impatience
Section 6.2: Add threshold triggers for impatience
```

## Impact Analysis

### Backward Compatibility
- Does this break existing implementations?
- Migration path for v0.x → v1.x?

### Implementation Complexity
- How hard is this to implement?
- Does it increase maintenance burden?

### Interoperability
- Can two implementations with different interpretations coexist?
- Any ambiguities introduced?

## Alternatives Considered

What other approaches did you consider? Why were they rejected?

**Example:**
- **Alternative 1:** [Description] — Rejected because [reason]
- **Alternative 2:** [Description] — Rejected because [reason]

## Reference Implementation
